The core objective is to implement and evaluate a **Random Forest Regressor**, compare it with a Simple Linear Regression model, and assess performance using various regression metrics and visualizations.
- This project explores how well a machine learning model can predict calories burned based on the number of steps taken per day. 
- [Fitbase Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) from Kaggle has been used. This dataset contains daily activity measures in 30 days tracked using a Fitbit smart watch among 33 users. 

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned the data by dropping rows with missing values in the relevant columns.
- Defined 'TotalSteps' as the input feature (X) and 'Calories' as the target variable (y).
- Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.

### Model Development

#### A. Baseline (Mean Predictor)
- Establish a baseline performance by calculating the *mean of the training target* (i.e. mean_calories) 
    - This serves as a *baseline* for minimum expected performance.
    - This ignores all input features (i.e. *'TotalSteps'*). It simply predicts the same value — the average (mean) of the *Calories* in the training data — for every single test sample.
    - If the advanced model (e.g., Random Forest) doesn't *perform better* than this simple mean predictor, then the complex model may not be useful.

#### B. Linear Regression
- Built a simple *LinearRegression* model using the same training and testing data.
    - Used this model to benchmark the Random Forest results.

#### C. Random Forest Regressor
1. Initialized a *RandomForestRegressor* algorithm with basic hyperparameters (e.g., *n_estimators*=100, *random_state*=0).
2. Trained the model on the training data *(X_train)* and *(y_train)*.
3. Made predictions on the test set *(y_pred)*.
4. Employed *GridSearchCV* to tune Random Forest hyperparameters

### Model Evaluation
- Various performance metrics to evaluate the model predictions for:
(A) Mean Baseline
(B) Linear Regression
(C) Random Forest

    1. Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Penalizes large errors.
    2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – Brings error to original unit (calories).
    3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – MAE gives average absolute error, easier to interpret than squared errors.
    4. R² Score – R² indicates how well the model explains variance in the data (closer to 1 is better).

- The baseline MSE/RMSE indicates the error generated by predicting the average calories every time.
- Comparing the RandomForest model’s MSE/RMSE to Mean Baseline shows if RandomForest model is actually learning something useful.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimized model for lowest validation error (MSE) for better prediction performance.
- Employed *GridSearchCV* to tune Random Forest hyperparameters:
    - n_estimators
    - max_depth
    - min_samples_split
    - min_samples_leaf
    - max_features

### Visualization
A. Prediction Quality
- Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted values with an identity line (y = x) to visualize prediction closeness.
- Residual Plot showing prediction errors to detect bias, variance, and patterns.

B. Model Performance
- Bar plots comparing MSE, RMSE, and MAE between Random Forest, Linear Regression, and the Mean Baseline.
