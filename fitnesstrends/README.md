# Bellabeat Case Study

## Aim
Identify potential opportunities for growth and provide recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy based on trends in usage of smart devices.

## Key Questions
1. What are the current trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence the Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Data Source
Kaggle data set [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) has been used for this case study.

- This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

- 30 eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data for 31 days, such as their minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

## Data Analysis
- Data analysis and visualizations were performed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks within Visual Studio Code.
- Datasets used - dailyIntensities_merged, dailySteps_merged, dailyCalories_merged (to be described more...)
- 

## Report
### 1. Trends in device usage

- **Figures 1 and 2** provide an overview of how users allocate their time, offering valuable insights into how the device is being utilized.
- The predominance of red shades in the visualizations is concerning, as it highlights a significant amount of sedentary behaviorâ€”likely representing time spent sitting or lying down.
- Approximately **80%** of the recorded time is sedentary, suggesting that the device is not being used to its full potential for promoting physical activity. 
- In contrast, only around **3%** of the time reflects moderate to vigorous activity, indicating limited engagement in more active behaviors.

**Figure 1:** This bar graph shows the activity patterns of users. The X-axis contains user id, and the Y-axis represents average time (minutes) during the 31 days of device usage.

### 2. Counting Daily Steps

- **Figure 3** illustrates the trends in average daily step count per user in 31 days. Additionally, a list of users categorized by activity zone can be generated (see the **"Step Goal"** section in the code).

### 4. Multiple linear regression model
- A multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the influence of time spent in each activity zone on calorie expenditure. 
- The independent variables are the durations spent in each activity zone, while the dependent variable is the average calorie expenditure. 
- The correlation matrix in **Figure 4** shows that the least calories are expended during sedentary activity, and calorie expenditure increases with higher activity levels. 
- **Figure 5**  presents a scatter plot illustrating the distribution of user trends. Sedentary activity (red dots) consistently shows the longest duration combined with the lowest calorie expenditure.

![Subplots](kaggle/figures/figure_6.png)

**Figure 6:** Subplots of Scatter plot of Multiple Linear Regression models with regression line.

- To better understand the relationship within each activity zone, subplots with regression lines are displayed in **Figure 6**.
- The most notable trend is that a user in the sedentary zone may spend approximately **1,300 minutes** to burn **2,250 calories**, whereas only about **30 minutes** of vigorous activity can burn the same amount.
- The regression lines reveal a steeper negative slope for vigorous activity, indicating higher efficiency in calorie expenditure, while the sedentary activity shows an almost flat slope, reflecting minimal impact on calorie burn regardless of time spent.


## Recommendations 
To encourage device usage, we need to encourage levels of physical activty in the users. 

#### 1. How does each user fair against rest of the users? 
- Giving each user a visualisation such as the above plot is likely to be effective to increase their activity levels. 
- On the other hand, Bellabeat could also provide plots per day of the week, encouraging the user to be more active in the following day. 
- You could also give feedback in the form of ranking or badges for reaching a certain goal.

#### 2. Traget least active users
- Least active users are identified by the time spent on the device.
- Send them alerts to move, where they stand in terms of physical activity. 

#### 3. Personalised goal
- Based on the users' activity zone, Bellabeat can send them trageted goals of step count per day with an informative message.
- Step goal recommendations are based on CDC Guildelines, they can also receive related articles which are attached below in **References**.

## Conclusion
- Understanding trends in physical activity is essential for developing effective strategies to increase smart device usage. 
- While analyzing additional datasets could yield further insights, this project focuses on activity zones, daily step counts, and average calorie expenditure. 
- Based on the data analysis, I have also provided evidence-based recommendations to support and enhance user engagement.
