# Bellabeat Case Study

This is a case study aimed to identify trends in usage of smart devices for recording physical activity. Potential opportunities for growth and recommendations are provided to Bellabeat, a fitness company.

- Kaggle data set [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) has been used for this case study.

- Data analysis and visualizations were performed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks within Visual Studio Code.

- Based on the data analysis, I have also provided evidence-based recommendations to support and enhance user engagement, to ultimately improvre Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

- A detailed report of this case study can be found in the 'fitnesstrends_report.pdf'.
