# Bellabeat Case Study

This case study aims to identify trends in smart device usage for tracking physical activity and provides Bellabeat, a wellness company, with growth opportunities and data-driven marketing recommendations.

- Kaggle data set [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) has been used for this case study.

- Data analysis and visualizations were performed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks within Visual Studio Code.

- Based on the data analysis, I have also provided evidence-based recommendations to support and enhance user engagement, ultimately improving Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
